# Speech Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning

This project focuses on **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)**, where emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and more are predicted from human speech using deep learning techniques. The system uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to analyze features extracted from audio signals. The model is trained on the **RAVDESS** dataset, a widely used dataset for emotion-labeled speech.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Predicts emotions from audio data.
- **LSTM-CNN Model**: Deep learning model built with **Keras/TensorFlow**.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses **MFCC** and other audio features via **LIBROSA**.
- **RAVDESS Dataset**: High-quality dataset with labeled emotions in speech and song.
